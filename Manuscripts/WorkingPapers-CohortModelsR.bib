abstract = {Evidence about treatment efficacy and long-term toxicities for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early- stage breast cancer is often presented in different formats and studies. This leads to challenges for patients and their physi- cians to adequately weigh the trade-offs between effectiveness and long-term cardiac toxicity when making decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy. We used a decision-analytic framework to quantify these trade-offs by combining the available evi- dence into a single, comparable metric. We developed a Markov model to simulate a hypothetical cohort of newly diag- nosed breast cancer patients under three scenarios: no treatment, anthracycline (AC)-based adjuvant chemotherapy (more effective but also more cardiotoxic), and non-AC-based adjuvant chemotherapy. We derived the model parameters from medical literature (e.g., clinical trials). Our primary outcome is 10-year mortality, and other metrics such as cause of death; life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs over 10 years were evaluated in sensitivity analysis. For 55-year-old women with a 10-year risk of metastatic recurrence {\textless}12.5{\%} no chemotherapy resulted in the preferred strategy. In general, non- AC-based adjuvant chemotherapy resulted in lower 10-year mortality than AC-based chemotherapy. Patients with low risk of metastatic recurrence are better off without adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of the outcome considered (i.e., the risks of cardiac toxicity from chemotherapy outweighed the benefits). Trade-offs between effectiveness and induced cardiac toxi- city impact health outcomes. The choice of adjuvant treatment must consider the patient's risk of distant recurrence and the quality of life associated with different health outcomes.},

@article{Hollman2017,
abstract = {The volume and technical complexity of both academic and commercial research using decision analytic modelling has increased rapidly over the last two decades. The range of software programs used for their implementation has also increased, but it remains true that a small number of programs account for the vast majority of cost-effectiveness modelling work. We report a comparison of four software programs: TreeAge Pro, Microsoft Excel, R and MATLAB. Our focus is on software commonly used for building Markov models and decision trees to conduct cohort simulations, given their predominance in the published literature around cost-effectiveness modelling. Our comparison uses three qualitative criteria as proposed by Eddy et al.: “transparency and validation”, “learning curve” and “capability”. In addition, we introduce the quantitative criterion of processing speed. We also consider the cost of each program to academic users and commercial users. We rank the programs based on each of these criteria. We find that, whilst Microsoft Excel and TreeAge Pro are good programs for educational purposes and for producing the types of analyses typically required by health technology assessment agencies, the efficiency and transparency advantages of programming languages such as MATLAB and R become increasingly valuable when more complex analyses are required.},

abstract = {The authors propose the use of two new standardized measures of risk, the standardized lifetime risk and the standardized number of years of life lost. These measures maintain the advantages of standardized rates but are more readily understood without special training. In this paper, standardizing weights based on 1992 data from England and Wales are provided, and the new measures are illustrated with a variety of examples. The new standardized rates are useful for examining trends over time; for comparing the impact of various diseases on public health; and for comparing rates of a given disease in several different countries. The authors think it is far more informative to say that 41 out of every 1,000 women die of breast cancer than to say that the standardized mortality rate is 51 per 100,000 women per year.},

abstract = {Background Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV/HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and even death. In a low endemic country as the Netherlands, migrants are a key risk group and could benefit from early diagnosis and antiviral treatment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening foreign-born migrants for chronic HBV and/or HCV using a societal perspective. Methods The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model. Estimates on prevalence, screening programme costs, participation and treatment uptake, transition probabilities, healthcare costs, productivity losses and utilities were derived from the literature. The cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was estimated and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results For most migrant groups with an expected high number of chronically infected cases in the Netherlands combined screening is cost-effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranging from €4,962/QALY gained for migrants originating from the Former Soviet Union and Vietnam to €9,375/QALY gained for Polish migrants. HBV and HCV screening proved to be cost-effective for migrants from countries with chronic HBV or HCV prevalence of 0.41{\%} and 0.22{\%}, with ICERs below the Dutch cost-effectiveness reference value of €20,000/QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment costs influenced the ICER for both infections. Conclusions For most migrant populations in a low-endemic country offering combined HBV and HCV screening is cost-effective. Implementation of targeted HBV and HCV screening programmes to increase early diagnosis and treatment is important to reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B and C among migrants.},

Methods—Data used to prepare the 2014 life tables are 2014 final mortality statistics; July 1, 2014 population estimates based on the 2010 decennial census; and 2014 Medicare data for persons aged 66–99. The methodology used to estimate the life tables for the Hispanic population remains unchanged from the methodology developed for the publication of life tables by Hispanic origin for data year 2006. The methodology used to estimate the 2014 life tables for all other groups was first implemented with data year 2008. Results—In 2014, the overall expectation of life at birth was 78.9 years, a 0.1-year increase from 2013. Between 2013 and 2014, life expectancy at birth increased by 0.1 year for both males (76.4 to 76.5) and females (81.2 to 81.3) and for the black (75.5 to 75.6) and white (79.0 to 79.1) populations. Life expectancy at birth increased by 0.2 years for the Hispanic (81.9 to 82.1) and non-Hispanic black (75.1 to 75.3) populations.

abstract = {Following its introduction over three decades ago, the cohort model has been used extensively to model population trajectories over time in decision-analytic modeling and health decision analysis studies. However, the stochastic process underlying cohort models has not been properly described. In this study, we explicate the stochastic process underlying a cohort model, by carefully formulating the dynamics of populations across health states and assigning probability rules on these dynamics. From this formulation, we explicate a mathematical representation of the system, which is given by the master equation: an evolution equation of the associated probability distribution. We solve the master equation by using the probability generation function method to obtain the explicit form of the probability of observing a particular realization of the system at an arbitrary time. The resulting generating function is used to derive the analytical expressions for calculating the mean and the variance of the process. Secondly, we represent the cohort model by a difference equation for the number of individuals across all states. From the difference equation, a continuous-time cohort model is recovered and takes the form of an ordinary differential equation. To show the equivalence between the derived stochastic process and the cohort model, we conduct a numerical exercise. We demonstrate that the population trajectories generated from the formulas match those from the cohort model simulation. In summary, the commonly-used cohort model represent the average of a continuous-time stochastic process on a multidimensional integer lattice governed by a master equation. Knowledge of the stochastic process underlying a cohort model provides a theoretical foundation for the modeling method.},

abstract = {Background. Modeling guidelines recommend applying a half-cycle correction (HCC) to outcomes from discrete-time state-transition models (DTSTMs). However, there is still no consensus on why and how to perform the correction. The objective was to provide theoretical foundations for HCC and to compare (both mathematically and numerically) the performance of different correction methods in reducing errors in outcomes from DTSTMs. Methods. We defined 7 methods from the field of numerical integration: Riemann sum of rectangles (left, midpoint, right), trapezoids, life-table, and Simpson's 1/3rd and 3/8th rules. We applied these methods to a standard 3-state disease progression Markov chain to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical intervention. We solved the discrete- and continuous-time (our gold standard) versions of the model analytically and derived expressions for various outcomes including discounted quality-adjusted life-years, discounted costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results. The standard HCC method gave the same results as the trapezoidal rule and life-table method. We found situations where applying the standard HCC can do more harm than good. Compared with the gold standard, all correction methods resulted in approximation errors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the errors need not cancel each other out or become insignificant when incremental outcomes are calculated. We found that a wrong decision can be made with a less accurate method. The performance of each correction method vastly improved when a shorter cycle length was selected; Simpson's 1/3rd rule was the fastest method to converge to the gold standard. Conclusion. Cumulative outcomes in DTSTMs are prone to errors that can be reduced with more accurate methods like Simpson's rules. We clarified several misconceptions and provided recommendations and algorithms for practical implementation of these methods.},

abstract = {Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement gene testing is used increasingly to identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are most likely to benefit from crizotinib. This study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the ALK tests followed by crizotinib compared to the standard chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. Methods A 10-year Markov model was constructed to compare the costs and quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs) of crizotinib with standard chemotherapy, guided by the ALK rearrangement tests: next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel tests and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The health states included progression-free survival (PFS), progressed survival, and death. The costs examined included cost of drugs (pemetrexed, standard chemotherapy, salvage chemotherapy, and crizotinib), follow-up, palliative care, supportive care, severe adverse events, and ALK rearrangement testing. Results Under Patient Assistance Program (PAP), the model demonstrated that the patients using NGS panel tests spent US {\$}31,388 and gained 0.780 QALYs, whereas patients using multiplex PCR spent US {\$}31,362 and gained 0.780 QALYs, respectively. The incremental costeffectiveness ratios of crizotinib with PAP compared to the control strategy were projected at {\$}14,384 (NGS) and {\$}13,740 (multiplex PCR) per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed the utility of PFS and the costs of crizotinib and pemetrexed were the most impactful factors on the model outcomes. The results were robust to changes in all parameters. Conclusion ALK-rearrangement test positive followed by crizotinib may be cost-effective compared to standard chemotherapy from the Chinese healthcare system perspective when PAP was available.},

abstract = {Following its introduction over three decades ago, the cohort model has been used extensively to model population trajectories over time in decision-analytic modeling and health decision analysis studies. However, the stochastic process underlying cohort models has not been properly described. In this study, we explicate the stochastic process underlying a cohort model, by carefully formulating the dynamics of populations across health states and assigning probability rules on these dynamics. From this formulation, we explicate a mathematical representation of the system, which is given by the master equation: an evolution equation of the associated probability distribution. We solve the master equation by using the probability generation function method to obtain the explicit form of the probability of observing a particular realization of the system at an arbitrary time. The resulting generating function is used to derive the analytical expressions for calculating the mean and the variance of the process. Secondly, we represent the cohort model by a difference equation for the number of individuals across all states. From the difference equation, a continuous-time cohort model is recovered and takes the form of an ordinary differential equation. To show the equivalence between the derived stochastic process and the cohort model, we conduct a numerical exercise. We demonstrate that the population trajectories generated from the formulas match those from the cohort model simulation. In summary, the commonly-used cohort model represent the average of a continuous-time stochastic process on a multidimensional integer lattice governed by a master equation. Knowledge of the stochastic process underlying a cohort model provides a theoretical foundation for the modeling method.},

@article{Hawkins2005,
abstract = {When constructing decision-analytic models to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative treatments, we often need to extrapolate beyond the available experimental data, as these typically relate to a limited period starting from the initiation of a new treatment or the diagnosis of the current disease state. We may also be required to extrapolate beyond the available experimental evidence to compare potential treatment sequences. Markov models are often used for this extrapolation. These models have the defining assumption that future transition probabilities are independent of past transitions. This means that, in general, transition probabilities cannot be conditional of the time spent in a given state. Where data exist to show that the risks of transition are conditional on the time spent in the treatment state, the simplifying Markov assumption can result in a loss in the model's "face validity," and misleading results might be generated. Several methods are available to incorporate time dependency into transition probabilities based on standard methods and software. These include the inclusion of tunnel states in Markov models and patient-level simulation, where a series of individual patients are simulated. This article considers the features and limitations of these methods and also describes a novel approach to building time dependency into a Markov model by incorporating an additional time dimension resulting in a "semi-Markov" model. An example of the implementation of such a model, using the R statistical programming language, is illustrated using a cost-effectiveness model for new epilepsy therapies.},

@article{Djatche2018,
abstract = {Background: Suboptimal adherence to aspirin therapy for secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events is an important public health problem. Prior studies have demonstrated non-adherent patients are at higher risk of experiencing CV events. Objectives: This study aimed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes of aspirin non-adherence in patients with a prior primary CV event. Methods: We developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of aspirin adherence from a generic US managed care payer perspective over a 5-year time horizon. Costs, utilities and rates of aspirin adherence, CV events and adverse events were gathered from published literature to populate the model. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (US{\$}) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We applied the model separately to a population without type II diabetes as a comorbidity (non-diabetic model) and a population with type II diabetes (type II diabetes model). A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the model uncertainty. Results: The base case showed adherent patients lived 0.25 and 0.36 QALYs longer than non-adherent patients in the non-diabetic model and type II diabetes model, respectively. Adherence to aspirin had an ICER of US{\$}25/QALY in the non-diabetic population, while it saved US{\$}297 per patient over a 5-year period in the type II diabetes population. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the models were most sensitive to rates of non-fatal events in non-adherent patients. Conclusion: This study suggests aspirin adherence may improve QALYs for patients with a prior primary CV event. Further, it may decrease costs in patients with type II diabetes. While additional research is needed to validate these results, payers may wish to increase strategies to promote adherence in order to improve population health. Trial Registration: Not applicable.},

abstract = {In epidemiology incidence denotes the rate of occurrence of new cases (of disease), while prevalence is the frequency in the population (of diseased people). From a statistical point of view it is useful to understand incidence and prevalence in the parameter space, incidence as intensity (hazard) and prevalence as probability, and to relate observable quantities to these via a statistical model. In this paper such a framework is based on modelling each individual's dynamics in the Lexis diagram by a simple three-state stochastic process in the age direction and recruiting individuals from a Poisson process in the time direction. The resulting distributions in the cross-sectional population allow a rigorous discussion of the interplay between age-specific incidence and prevalence as well as of the statistical analysis of epidemiological cross-sectional data. For the latter, this paper focuses on methods from modern nonparametric continuous time survival analysis, including random censoring and truncation models and estimation under monotonicity constraints. The exposition is illustrated by examples, primarily from the author's epidemiological experience.},

Our purpose is to collect it in one location to serve as a stand-alone resource for decision modelers who draw most or all of their information from the published literature. Our focus is on the technical aspects of manipulating data to derive transition probabilities. We explain how to derive model transition probabilities from the following types of statistics: relative risks, odds, odds ratios, and rates. We then review the well-known approach for converting probabilities to match the model's cycle length when there are two health-state transitions and how to handle the case of three or more health-state transitions, for which the two-state approach is not appropriate. Other topics discussed include transition probabilities for population subgroups, issues to keep in mind when using data from different sources in the derivation process, and sensitivity analyses, including the use of sensitivity analysis to allocate analyst effort in refining transition probabilities and ways to handle sources of uncertainty that are not routinely formalized in models. The paper concludes with recommendations to help modelers make the best use of the published literature.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To identify best-fitting input sets using model calibration, individual calibration target fits are often combined into a single goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure using a set of weights. Decisions in the calibration process, such as which weights to use, influence which sets of model inputs are identified as best-fitting, potentially leading to different health economic conclusions. We present an alternative approach to identifying best-fitting input sets based on the concept of Pareto-optimality. A set of model inputs is on the Pareto frontier if no other input set simultaneously fits all calibration targets as well or better. METHODS: We demonstrate the Pareto frontier approach in the calibration of 2 models: a simple, illustrative Markov model and a previously published cost-effectiveness model of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). For each model, we compare the input sets on the Pareto frontier to an equal number of best-fitting input sets according to 2 possible weighted-sum GOF scoring systems, and we compare the health economic conclusions arising from these different definitions of best-fitting. RESULTS: For the simple model, outcomes evaluated over the best-fitting input sets according to the 2 weighted-sum GOF schemes were virtually nonoverlapping on the cost-effectiveness plane and resulted in very different incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ({\$}79,300 [95{\%} CI 72,500-87,600] v. {\$}139,700 [95{\%} CI 79,900-182,800] per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Input sets on the Pareto frontier spanned both regions ({\$}79,000 [95{\%} CI 64,900-156,200] per QALY gained). The TAVR model yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Choices in generating a summary GOF score may result in different health economic conclusions. The Pareto frontier approach eliminates the need to make these choices by using an intuitive and transparent notion of optimality as the basis for identifying best-fitting input sets.},

Cohort state-transition models (cSTM) are decision models commonly used in medical decision making because they can simulate hypothetical cohorts' transitions across various health states over time. This tutorial shows how to conceptualize cSTMs in a programming language environment and shows examples of their implementation in R. We illustrate their use in a cost-effectiveness analysis of a treatment using a previously published testbed cSTM. Both time-independent cSTM where transition probabilities are constant over time and time-dependent cSTM where transition probabilities vary over time are represented. For the time-dependent cSTM, we consider transition probabilities dependent on age and state residence. We also illustrate how this setup can facilitate the computation of epidemiological outcomes of interest, such as survival and prevalence. We conclude by demonstrating how to calculate economic outcomes and conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis of a treatment compared to usual care using the testbed model. We provide a link to a public repository with all the R code described in this tutorial that can be used to replicate the example or to be modified to suit different decision modeling needs.},

@article{Soares2012,
abstract = {The design of decision-analytic models for cost-effectiveness analysis has been the subject of discussion. The current work addresses this issue by noting that, when time is to be explicitly modelled, we need to represent phenomena occurring in continuous time. Models evaluated in continuous time may not have closed-form solutions, and in this case, two approximations can be used: simulation models in continuous time and discretized models at the aggregate level. Stylized examples were set up where both approximations could be implemented. These aimed to illustrate determinants of the use of the two approximations: cycle length and precision, the use of continuity corrections in discretized models and the discretization of rates into probabilities. The examples were also used to explore the impact of the approximations not only in terms of absolute survival but also cost effectiveness and incremental comparisons. Discretized models better approximate continuous time results if lower cycle lengths are used. Continuous time simulation models are inherently stochastic, and the precision of the results is determined by the simulation sample size. The use of continuity corrections in discretized models allows the use of greater cycle lengths, producing no significant bias from the discretization. How the process is discretized (the conversion of rates into probabilities) is key. Results show that appropriate discretization coupled with the use of a continuity correction produces results unbiased for higher cycle lengths. Alternative methods of discretization are less efficient, i.e. lower cycle lengths are needed to obtain unbiased results. The developed work showed the importance of acknowledging bias in estimating cost effectiveness. When the alternative approximations can be applied, we argue that it is preferable to implement a cohort discretized model rather than a simulation model in continuous time. In practice, however, it may not be possible to represent the decision problem by any conventionally defined discretized model, in which case other model designs need to be applied, e.g. a simulation model.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 'lifetime risk' of cancer is generally estimated by combining current incidence rates with current all-cause mortality ('current probability' method) rather than by describing the experience of a birth cohort. As individuals may get more than one type of cancer, what is generally estimated is the average (mean) number of cancers over a lifetime. This is not the same as the probability of getting cancer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We describe a method for estimating lifetime risk that corrects for the inclusion of multiple primary cancers in the incidence rates routinely published by cancer registries. The new method applies cancer incidence rates to the estimated probability of being alive without a previous cancer. The new method is illustrated using data from the Scottish Cancer Registry and is compared with 'gold-standard' estimates that use (unpublished) data on first primaries.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The effect of this correction is to make the estimated 'lifetime risk' smaller. The new estimates are extremely similar to those obtained using incidence based on first primaries. The usual 'current probability' method considerably overestimates the lifetime risk of all cancers combined, although the correction for any single cancer site is minimal.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Estimation of the lifetime risk of cancer should either be based on first primaries or should use the new method.},

abstract = {Background. Health economic evaluations frequently include projections for lifetime costs and health effects using modeling frameworks such as Markov modeling or discrete event simulation (DES). Markov models typically cannot represent events whose risk is determined by the length of time spent in state (sojourn time) without the use of tunnel states. DES is very flexible but introduces Monte Carlo variation, which can significantly limit the complexity of model analyses. Methods. We present a new methodological framework for health economic modeling that is based on, and extends, the concept of moment-generating functions (MGFs) for time-to-event random variables. When future costs and health effects are discounted, MGFs can be used to very efficiently calculate the total discounted life-years spent in a series of health states. Competing risks are incorporated into the method. This method can also be used to calculate discounted costs and health effects when these payoffs are constant per unit time, one-off, or exponential with regard to time. MGFs are extended to additionally support costs and health effects which are polynomial with regard to time (as in a commonly used model of population norms for EQ-5D utility). Worked Example. A worked example is used to demonstrate the application of the new method in practice and to compare it with Markov modeling and DES. Results are compared in terms of convergence and accuracy, and computation times are compared. R code and an Excel workbook are provided. Conclusions. The MGF method can be applied to health economic evaluations in the place of Markov modeling or DES and has certain advantages over both.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Dynamic processes in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) are typically described using cohort simulations, which can be implemented as Markov models, or alternatively using systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In the field of CEA, simple and potentially inaccurate single-step algorithms are commonly used for solving ODEs, which can potentially induce bias, especially if an incorrect step size is used. The aims of this project were 1) to implement and demonstrate the use of a modern and well-established hybrid linear multistep ODE solver algorithm (LSODA) in the context of CEA using the statistical scripting language R and 2) to quantify bias in outcome for a case example CEA as generated by a commonly used single-step ODE solver algorithm. METHODS A previously published CEA comparing the adjuvant breast cancer therapies anastrozole and tamoxifen was used as a case example to implement the computational framework. A commonly used single-step algorithm was compared with the proposed multistep algorithm to quantify bias in the single-step method. RESULTS A framework implementing the multistep ODE solver LSODA was successfully developed. When a single-step ODE solver with step size of 1 year was used, incremental life-years gained was underestimated by 0.016 years (5.6{\%} relative error, RE) and {\pounds}158 (6.8{\%} RE) compared with the multistep method. CONCLUSION The framework was found suitable for the conduct of CEAs. We demonstrated how the use of single-step algorithms with insufficiently small step sizes causes unnecessary bias in outcomes measures of CEAs. Scripting languages such as R can further improve transparency, reproducibility, and overall integrity in the field of health economics.},

This has implications for the proper modeling of prognosis and transition between health states in decision analysis and related techniques. The issue is complicated by the plethora of terms related to rate and risk. Although the suggestion to use the terms force and probability as substitutes for rate and risk has some appeal, the change in terminology by itself is unlikely to solve all the confusion or misuse of terms. This paper clarifies the proper definitions and estimations of rates and risks and suggests critical factors for the decision analyst to re- member when using, modeling, or interpreting transition rates and risks.

abstract = {Fay, Pfeiffer, Cronin, Le, and Feuer (Statistics in Medicine 2003; 22; 1837-1848) developed a formula to calculate the age-conditional probability of developing a disease for the first time (ACPDvD) for a hypothetical cohort. The novelty of the formula of Fay et al (2003) is that one need not know the rates of first incidence of disease per person-years alive and disease-free, but may input the rates of first incidence per person-years alive only. Similarly the formula uses rates of death from disease and death from other causes per person-years alive. The rates per person-years alive are much easier to estimate than per person-years alive and disease-free. Fay et al (2003) used simple piecewise constant models for all three rate functions which have constant rates within each age group. In this paper, we detail a method for estimating rate functions which does not have jumps at the beginning of age groupings, and need not be constant within age groupings. We call this method the mid-age group joinpoint (MAJ) model for the rates. The drawback of the MAJ model is that numerical integration must be used to estimate the resulting ACPDvD. To increase computational speed, we offer a piecewise approximation to the MAJ model, which we call the piecewise mid-age group joinpoint (PMAJ) model. The PMAJ model for the rates input into the formula for ACPDvD described in Fay et al (2003) is the current method used in the freely available DevCan software made available by the National Cancer Institute.},

abstract = {Markov models are a simple and powerful tool for analyzing the health and economic effects of health care interventions. These models are usually evaluated in discrete time using cohort analysis. The use of discrete time assumes that changes in health states occur only at the end of a cycle period. Discrete-time Markov models only approximate the process of disease progression, as clinical events typically occur in continuous time. The approximation can yield biased cost-effectiveness estimates for Markov models with long cycle periods and if no half-cycle correction is made. The purpose of this article is to present an overview of methods for evaluating Markov models in continuous time. These methods use mathematical results from stochastic process theory and control theory. The methods are illustrated using an applied example on the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The main result is a mathematical solution for the expected time spent in each state in a continuous-time Markov model. It is shown how this solution can account for age-dependent transition rates and discounting of costs and health effects, and how the concept of tunnel states can be used to account for transition rates that depend on the time spent in a state. The applied example shows that the continuous-time model yields more accurate results than the discrete-time model but does not require much computation time and is easily implemented. In conclusion, continuous-time Markov models are a feasible alternative to cohort analysis and can offer several theoretical and practical advantages.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Markov chain models are frequently used to study the clinical course of chronic diseases. The aim of this article is to adopt statistical methods to describe the time dynamics of chronically ill patients when 2 kinds of data sets--fully and partially observable data are available.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMODEL: We propose a 6-state continuous-time Markov chain model for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), where little is known about the transitions between the disease stages. States 1 to 3 of the model correspond to stages III to V of chronic kidney disease in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) CKD classification. States 4 and 5 relate to dialysis and transplantation (renal replacement therapy), respectively. Death is the (absorbing) state 6.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND DATA: The model can be investigated and identified using Kolmogorov's forward equations and the methods of survival analysis. Age dependency, covariates in the form of the Cox regression, and unobservable risks of transition (frailties) can be included in the model. We applied our model to a data set consisting of all 2097 patients from all renal centers in a region in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) in 2005-2010.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We compared transitions and relative risks to the few data published and found them to be reasonable. For example, patients with diabetes had a significantly higher risk for disease progression compared with patients without diabetes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, modeling may help to quantify disease progression and its predictors when only partially observable prospective data are available.},

abstract = {The use of open-source programming languages, such as R, in health decision sciences is growing and has the potential to facilitate model transparency, reproducibility, and shareability. However, realizing this potential can be challenging. Models are complex and primarily built to answer a research question, with model sharing and transparency relegated to being sec- ondary goals. Consequently, code is often neither well documented nor systematically organized in a comprehensible and shareable approach. Moreover, many decision modelers are not formally trained in computer programming and may lack good coding practices, further compounding the problem of model transparency. To address these challenges, we propose a high-level framework for model-based decision and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) in R. The proposed framework consists of a conceptual, modular structure and coding recommendations for the implementation of model-based decision analyses in R. This framework defines a set of common decision model elements divided into five components: (1) model inputs, (2) decision model implementation, (3) model calibration, (4) model validation, and (5) analysis. The first four components form the model development phase. The analysis component is the application of the fully developed decision model to answer the policy or the research question of interest, assess decision uncertainty, and/or to determine the value of future research through value of information (VOI) analysis. In this framework, we also make recommendations for good coding practices specific to decision modeling, such as file organization and variable naming conventions. We showcase the framework through a fully functional, testbed decision model, which is hosted on GitHub for free download and easy adaptation to other applications. The use of this framework in decision modeling will improve code readability and model sharing, paving the way to an ideal, open-source world. 1},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective is to develop a method for calculating the prevalence of stroke based on Markov models and to apply it to the assessment of the budget impact analysis of thrombolytic treatment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A Markov model was used to reproduce the natural history of stroke. The first step was to run the model to build the sojourn matrix from the initial population vector. The second step was to ascertain the number of individuals in the origin of each annual cohort. Finally, prevalence figures were obtained, validated, and used to calculate the impact of treatment with thrombolysis in 10{\%} of patients with stroke in the Basque Country as if thrombolysis had begun in 2000 and would continue to 2015.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Stroke prevalence rates per 100,000 for the entire population are 898 for men and 686 for women, with a combined rate of 774 for men and women. Rates for stroke-related disability are 358 per 100,000 for men, 275 for women, and 309 for men and women combined. If 10{\%} of the stroke patients would have received thrombolytic treatment from 2000 to 2015, the number of disabled in 2015 would be reduced by 328, and the net savings for the Basque society (2,100,000 inhabitants) would be 1.7 million euro.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The budget impact analysis of thrombolysis for stroke starting in 2000 shows a positive impact on the health budget because it saves costs after 2006 and produces a net benefit in health from the beginning of treatment.},

abstract = {A model's purpose is to inform medical decisions and health care resource allocation. Modelers employ quantitative methods to structure the clinical, epidemiological, and economic evidence base and gain qualitative insight to assist decision makers in making better decisions. From a policy perspective, the value of a model-based analysis lies not simply in its ability to generate a precise point estimate for a specific outcome but also in the systematic examination and responsible reporting of uncertainty surrounding this outcome and the ultimate decision being addressed. Different concepts relating to uncertainty in decision modeling are explored. Stochastic (first-order) uncertainty is distinguished from both parameter (second-order) uncertainty and from heterogeneity, with structural uncertainty relating to the model itself forming another level of uncertainty to consider. The article argues that the estimation of point estimates and uncertainty in parameters is part of a single process and explores the link between parameter uncertainty through to decision uncertainty and the relationship to value-of-information analysis. The article also makes extensive recommendations around the reporting of uncertainty, both in terms of deterministic sensitivity analysis techniques and probabilistic methods. Expected value of perfect information is argued to be the most appropriate presentational technique, alongside cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, for representing decision uncertainty from probabilistic analysis.},

@article{Krijkamp2019,
abstract = {Cost-effectiveness analyses often rely on cohort state-transition models (cSTMs). The cohort trace is the primary outcome of cSTMs, which captures the proportion of the cohort in each health state over time (state occupancy). However, the cohort trace is an aggregated measure that does not capture the information about the specific transitions among the health states (transition dynamics). In practice, these transition dynamics are crucial in many applications, such as incorporating transition rewards or computing various epidemiological outcomes that could be used for model calibration and validation (e.g. disease incidence and lifetime risk). In this manuscript we propose modifying the transitional cSTMs cohort trace computation to compute and store cSTMs dynamics that capture both state occupancy and transition dynamics. This approach produces a multidimensional matrix from which both the state occupancy and the transition dynamics can be recovered. We highlight the advantages and potential applications of this approach with an example coded in R to facilitate the implementation of our method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. Microsimulation models are becoming increasingly common in the field of decision modeling for health. Because microsimulation models are computationally more demanding than traditional Markov cohort models, the use of computer programming languages in their development has become more common. R is a programming language that has gained recognition within the field of decision modeling. It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models. We also show how this code can be extended to address more complex model structures and provide an efficient microsimulation approach that relies on vectorization solutions.},
