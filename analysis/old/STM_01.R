# Implements a time-independent Sick-Sicker cSTM model                        #
# Usual care: best available care for the patients with the disease. This scenario reflects the natural history of the disease progressions
# New treatment 1: this new treatment is given to all sick patients, patients in sick and sicker, but does only improves the utility of those being sick.
# New treatment 2: the new treatment reduces disease progression from sick to sicker. However, it is not possible to distinguish those sick from sicker and therefore all individuals in one of the two sick states get the treatment.  
# New treatment 1 & new treatment 2‚Äù: This strategy combines the new treatment 1 and new treatment 2. The disease progression is reduced and Sick individuals has an improved utility. 
# This is the base model.
